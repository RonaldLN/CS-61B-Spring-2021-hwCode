You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The two max methods in MaxArrayDeque, I thought. I implemented max() through invoking max(Comparator<T> c) other than copying implementation in it.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I think the .equals methods in ArrayDeque and LinkedListDeque are a little bit inelegant.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Seems not.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Maybe not, maybe same as what I do before.
